# multiple disease-detection
Developed a disease detection system using machine learning algorithms
like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression.
Implemented a model that can accurately predict multiple diseases
based on input symptoms and medical data. Leveraged Python and
libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas for data preprocessing, feature
selection, and model training. This project aimed to assist healthcare
professionals in diagnosing diseases efficiently and accurately. By
applying machine learning techniques, the system provides valuable
insights for early detection and improved patient care.
